            <p>
                In this movie server, when users submit comments for a movie, the system ensures that the authorities are notified. Upon
                receiving the notification, the authorities review the comments and have the discretion to approve or disapprove them.
                Once a comment is approved by the authorities, it becomes visible to both the commenter and all other users of the
                platform. This process allows for moderation and ensures that only authorized and appropriate comments are displayed for
                everyone to see, fostering a controlled and valuable movie discussion environment.
